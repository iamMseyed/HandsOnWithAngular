Directives:
===========
    -Structural:
    ------------
        Used to add/remove HTML content dynamically.
        e.g *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch

    -Behaviroual:
    -------------
        Used to add/remove CSS classes and styles dynamically
        e.g [ngStyle] and [ngClass]

    -Component:
    ----------
        When the above Directives didn't meet the requirements, we can have custom directives and
        implement the custom logic accordingly.
        e.g
        A custom directive is a class which is decorated with @Decorative();
